# ESP32_RNG

A Micro-python library which provides an interface to generate a TRUE random number using the ESP32's hardware RNG. 
It enables Wi-Fi temporarily to enhance entropic noise, reads a random value from the RNG_DATA_REG, and then disables Wi-Fi.

* Library :          **esp32_rng.py**
* Libarary test:     **test_esp32_rng.py**
* Example:           **esp32_rng_random_number.py**

Source:  Esp32 technical reference manual (Version 5.2) / Section 25.Random Number Generator (RNG) / Page #604


Example of "Classical" code **not using** the direct call to the ESP32 hardware and calling 'urandom' lib instead (pseudo random number)
* esp32_random_number.py

The ESP32 RNG generates random integer numbers as 32-bit values.

# TRNG validation
~~* Considering that the Espressif ESP32 chip has already been tested and approved using the Dieharder Random Number Test Suite (version 3.31.1),~~
~~I will not repeat the tests to validate the reliability of the generator.~~
### Update(24.11.24)

While testing my RNG on RP2040, I became very aware of the entropy weakness provided by my MCU generator. 

So the decision was to also test the Espressif ESP32 chip to confirm its reliability as a TRNG.

Testing tools used:

* Ent, Fourmilab Switzerland
* Dieharder version 3.31.1
